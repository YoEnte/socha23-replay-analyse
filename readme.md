this is a replay analyse tool for the german software challenge 23

npm install xml-reader
npm install xml-query

put replays.xml in "replays" folder (there are already five examples)
run node index.js

if you want to export to external file run: 'node index.js > outputFile.xyz'

hope there are no bugs (didn't test it that much) and every important feature is there

ps: the code has basically no error handling, therefore it cannot handle courrupted files or format errors
